## Overview
Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can generate new content, including text, images, audio, and more. These systems learn patterns from existing data and use that knowledge to create new, original content.

## Key Concepts
- **Neural Networks**: The foundation of modern AI systems
- **Transformers**: Architecture behind many language models
- **Training Data**: Critical for model performance and bias mitigation
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapting pre-trained models for specific tasks

## Applications
- Content creation
- Code generation
- Virtual assistants
- Creative tools for artists and designers

## Challenges
- Ethical considerations
- Bias in training data
- Computational requirements
- Evaluation metrics
